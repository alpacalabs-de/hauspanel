# Changelog

## 1.6.2

- Parcels: the sensors are now found by what they are, not by their name, so the chip also works when the parcel sensors are named in another language or renamed. Pickup and outgoing lists are left out as before.

## 1.6.1

- **Parcels** are now a status chip at the top of Home, like Waste and Maintenance: it shows when the next parcel comes or how many are on the way, and only while one is coming or just came. A tap opens the list with the parcels on their way and the ones delivered in the last two days; a tap on a parcel opens its tracking page. Switch the chip off under *Settings → Home → Status chips* or with − in edit mode. The parcel list further down on Home is gone.

## 1.6.0

- **Notices** (*Settings → Home → Notices*): pick entities of your own, like a helper for *Mail is here* or a washing machine sensor, and they show on Home only when they matter. Switches and helpers show while on; sensors and lists at the states you enter (several separated by commas, or a number like `>0`). A helper is cleared with the tick on its pill.
- **Parcels**: with the [parcel integrations](https://ha-parcel-integrations.github.io/) (one per carrier, or their aggregator) Home shows the parcels on their way: sender, carrier, status and when it comes, the next one first. A tap opens the tracking page. Switch them off under *Settings → Home → Notices*.
- Rooms with only a door contact, a motion sensor or other sensors now show up as well, with those sensors on their page.
- Scenes: *Tap to confirm* no longer runs out of the pill on the phone and in the side panel; long scene names end in "…".

## 1.5.3

- **Settings** on a big screen: a bigger window with the tabs as a list on the left. Sections with a single switch are merged (Rooms: opening, presence, scenes and shades in one place; Look: classic popups under Style), long lists (speakers, energy devices, cameras, device types, integrations) show their first six and *Show all*. On the phone, two-way choices sit below their label.
- Rooms with nothing to switch but a thermometer or another reading (a cellar, a storeroom) now show up, with their temperature, and their page shows what they measure.
- Room popup: the room's temperature shows once, on top, not again under *More in this room*.

## 1.5.2

- Settings → Energy on the phone: the sensor pickers sit below their label in full width instead of running over it. Other pickers in the settings shrink instead of overflowing.

## 1.5.1

- **Settings → Rooms & devices → Energy**: pick which sensor shows the house's, the solar roof's and each device's power right now, or leave a device out. Use and costs still come from Home Assistant's energy settings.
- A meter with three phases or several channels now shows its total instead of phase A.
- **Cameras**: the second, smaller stream of a camera (Reolink *fluent*, UniFi *low*, *sub* …) and still pictures of the last event start switched off on the Security page. *Settings → Security → Cameras* switches them on.

## 1.5.0

- **Floor buttons** in the room list (phone and tablet): next to each floor's name, one button switches all its lights off (or on when all are off), two more move all its shades up or down. Each shows only when the floor has such devices.
- Buttons that need two taps (gates, the doorbell opener, scenes) now say *Tap to confirm* after the first tap.
- **Favourites**: the picker has *Cards* on top: *Now playing* (the music card, whatever plays right now), Security, Climate and Today can be added like rooms and devices.
- **Settings → Rooms & devices → Speakers & TVs**: one switch per player; off hides it everywhere in HausPanel. The Media page and its player buttons list the same players as the rooms, each once.
- Media players that can't be reached get no tile; they come back by themselves once they are online again. Players that are just off stay.
- **Music Assistant**: its players, which come without a room, join the room of their twin (the speaker's own player with the same name or device name) and stand for it there, so a room shows the player that is really playing. Players with no twin get no tile under Other but still show on Home's music card while they play.
- **Gate and garage popup**: after the second tap it says *Sent – waiting for the door to move*, and when the door hasn't moved after 20 seconds, or Home Assistant refuses the command, it says so. Doors that can't stop (many garage openers) keep Open and Close while moving instead of showing a Stop that does nothing.
- A pool's filter pump is no longer shown like a washing machine, and a machine seen by two integrations (Home Connect and WashData) shows once.
- Browser Mod's own entities (the browser's "screen" light, media player and tab camera) stay out of rooms and security.
- Presence ignores sensors of things that move themselves (a car's *moving*, a phone): a sensor whose device has a device tracker doesn't count.
- **Presence in rooms** (a personal choice, *Settings → Rooms & devices → Show presence in rooms*): a small person on room cards and in the room list while someone is there, and in the room popup how long it has been quiet. Presence and occupancy sensors count; a room's motion sensors only when it has none, so a second, slower sensor of the same device doesn't count twice.

## 1.4.2

- Security popup, the settings list and the Security page use the same icons as the pills: a gate contact set up as a door shows a gate there too.
- Cameras: the red dot on a camera pulses only while pictures really arrive; while connecting or when a stream stalls it is grey.

## 1.4.1

- **Panel layout, left side**: *On now* can show under the scenes (Settings → This screen → Side panel), small and two per row; the scenes there are two per row too.
- Security pills: a gate allowed to be open says *OK until 19:00* instead of a text that ran out of the pill; a gate contact set up as a door gets a gate icon; long second lines end in "…".
- Status chips keep one line, so on the phone the Waste chip is as tall as the others.

## 1.4.0

- **Waste chip**: with Waste Collection Schedule or a waste calendar (Abfall, Müll, Waste, Trash, Bin …), a chip shows on Home the day before and on the day of a pickup (*Tomorrow: Yellow bin*), coloured by kind of bin; a tap shows the next two weeks.
- **Motion in the room popup**, a personal choice in *Settings → Rooms & devices*: *Motion now* or how long the room has been quiet.
- **Back up and restore** in *Settings → System*: the panel's settings as a file, and loading them back after a confirmation.
- **Take settings from another panel** (same place): from MobilePanel, HausPanel or SecurityPanel, either the house settings (hidden devices, door time windows, Security page cameras, doorbell, baby monitor, calendars, weather …) or everything.
- **Lite mode** in *Settings → This screen → Effects*: no blur, glow or endless animations. *Automatic* turns it on when the screen seems slow.

## 1.3.1

- Last movements: a **full screen** button next to the close button. On the iPhone the clip itself goes full screen.
- Edit mode: the **status chips** on Home can be dragged with a finger (the page no longer scrolls away) and no longer flip back and forth between chips of different widths; tiles sort the same steady way.

## 1.3.0

- **Maintenance** also lists devices that went quiet (a temperature, humidity or battery sensor without news for two days) and consumables that are nearly used up (filters, brushes, mops, dust bags, toner, ink at 10 % or less). Each can be ignored like the others.
- **Worth a look** at the top of the settings: devices without a room, rooms without a floor, cameras that can't be reached, each linking its guide.
- The last movements in the security popup only show when Frigate is there.
- **Clips play on the iPhone**: the last movements load the short clip first and play it from memory, since Home Assistant passes Frigate clips on without the byte ranges iPhones need. A spinner shows while it loads; without a clip yet, the snapshot.
- GitHub: forms for bug reports, ideas and translations; the README explains how to fix a translation and shows a short demo.

## 1.2.0

**New for everyone**
- **Welcome**: the first time you open HausPanel, three short steps: your rooms (how many were found, how many devices have no room), the layout for this screen, and where the settings and guides are. *Settings → System* shows it again.
- **Step by step**: guides in English and German in `docs/`, and a link to the right one on every settings tab.
- **More languages**: French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Swedish, besides English and German. The font now has the extended Latin letters too.

**Rooms**
- **Rooms tab**: on tablet and desktop every room at once, by floor, as cards, rows or compact rows. A tap opens the room popup, holding opens the room page (with *All rooms* to go back).
- **Shades in the room popup**: one wide tile with a slider that sets all shades of the room at once; expanded, one slim line per shade with its own slider, up and down (Stop while moving).
- Settings: *A tap on a room opens* with two clear choices, room at a glance or full room page.

**Security**
- **Cameras** in *Settings → Security*: which ones the Security page shows, and which ones the last movements come from.
- **Last movements** per person: the camera button next to them picks the cameras just for you; Home Assistant keeps the choice with your user.
- **Leaving home** and **Good night** warn when windows are open and rain, a thunderstorm or frost is coming in the next hours.

**Other**
- Status text on room cards stays on one line in every language.
- German texts now say *Sicherheits-Popup* and *Babyphone* throughout.

## 1.1.0

**Settings**
- New **Security** tab: watched doors, gates and locks (order, shown or hidden), when each may be open, the parts of the security popup, good night check, doorbell and baby monitor in one place.
- Every settings tab starts with one line on what it is for.

**Security**
- **May be open**: a time window per door, gate or lock (with weekdays, overnight works) in which it being open is not a warning.
- The Security chip and the security page open a popup: what is open, the alarm with its modes, smoke detectors, the last movements from Frigate with short clips, and Leaving.
- The security popup fits on one screen; a pencil arranges its parts.

**Rooms**
- Room popup with temperature ring, big tiles for light, shades, music and switches; per room you choose which sections are open by default.
- Shades as a draggable window with up, 50 %, down and stop, also for all shades of a room at once.
- Room tiles on the phone all have the same height; long names get a little smaller.

**Popups**
- Weather on one screen: sky for the time of day, feels like, humidity, wind, sunrise or sunset, the next hours and 7 days with rain.
- New or reworked popups for the wallbox, solar, heat pump, car, appliances and the good night check.

**Other**
- Cameras are told apart indoors and outdoors by their room, not by their name.
